# Basic_Image_Processing
This repository is a demonstration of some very basic image processing techniques using Python.

There are four techniques that are displayed:

- Edge Detection, which isolates edges within a given image
- Grayscaling, which will apply a grayscale to a given image
- Resizing, which can enlarge or scale a given image
- Rotation, which rotates a given image a specified amount of degrees
